# Energy-use-Prediction-in-Residential-Buildings-Using-LSTM
In this project, I developed a mullitvariate time-series deep learning model (LSTM) for prediction of energy use (kWh) in residential buildings. The dataset used for this experiement is a daily dataset collected for two different house IDs (i.e. 624 and 1103) for the year 2015. Each house ID has 365 datapoints with the following feature variables: id, timestamp, actual_energyuse (kWh), avg_temp_c (celcius). We evaluated the LSTM model by computing the test error (RMSE) and the coefficient of variation of RMSE and the following results were obtained for both house IDs: house id 624 (Test RMSE: 8.83, CV-RMSE: 1.54) , house id 1103 ( Test RMSE: 4.49, CV-RMSE: 0.93). The results show that the lstm model has a high accuracy.
